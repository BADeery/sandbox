# My Writing Styles

I’ve wrestled with trying to write in a way that feels recognisable - something grounded in the traditions and structures that give writing its weight.

But like most things in my life, my writing doesn’t slot neatly into expected moulds. So instead of forcing it to conform to familiar formats - essays, op-eds, reflective journals - I’ve decided to name my own styles.

Why?

Because I _do_ want to generate pieces that align with traditional expectations. I want to write academic essays, structured arguments, perhaps a reflective personal essay. But when my raw input generates an output that takes another form - yet still lands, still works, still feels worth reading - I want to honour that too.

When a piece has flow, structure, depth, and resonance - even if it doesn’t tick formal boxes {% quip "Especially if it doesn't tick all of the boxes" %} - I want to be able to say: _yep, that’s a **Deez** piece._ And if you enjoy it, I want to help you find more of it.

> This isn’t me creating my own box because I refused to fit the traditional ones.  
> It’s about building a box that represents its content better.

If you want the `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` answer: writing is supposed to be creative. Creative means I do what I want.

Below are the custom writing styles I use across this site:

## [`#LayeredPerspective`](/tags/layeredperspective/)

**Layered Perspective** is my way of holding complexity without flattening it. It’s reflective, structured, and threaded with ideas - a kind of braid.

This style:

- Connects personal insight with systems thinking
- Uses cultural memory and metaphor as scaffolds
- Leaves room for recursion, intuition, and shifts in orientation

It’s not quite personal, like a memoir.  
Not quite critical, like an opinion piece.  
Not neatly academic either.

But it’s structured. It lands. And it’s written with intent.

These pieces might quote a philosopher, drop a pop culture reference, and still land a proposal or provocation. They tend to start with something simple - almost comical - but layer in weight until it generates enough weight that causes you to take pause and consider the implications.

## [`#CreativeNavigation`](/tags/creativenavigation/)


**Creative Navigation** is non-fiction that borrows the techniques of fiction: scene, voice, metaphor, emotional truth.

It’s built from lived moments, internal shifts, and meaning-making - often shaped more like a story than a statement.

This style:

- Centres emotion, metaphor, and perspective as navigational tools
- Blends narrative craft with non-fiction truth
- Builds maps from the terrain of internal experience

It’s not quite memoir - even if built from lived moments.{% quip "Plus I keep getting told it's not all about me" %}  
Not quite fiction - there is too much truth sprinkled in it.  
Not quite journalism - but the details still carry weight.

Sometimes it's a similar story we've all heard numerous times, it's just wrapped in my own style of writing and language, making the flavour 
similar to something you know, but the wrapper was something you didn't recognise.

## More Traditional Styles

Coming soon. Some pieces will eventually fit more familiar moulds: essays, critiques, annotated reflections.  
Just not today.
