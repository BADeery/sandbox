      <p><i data-lucide="hand"></i> I’m an everything-thinker who finds peace amongst the chaos.</p>
      <p><i data-lucide="wrench" class="icon-adjust"></i> I consider myself a Swiss Army Knife — I'm great at a lot of things — but I know when to hand it off to an expert.</p>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem"><i data-lucide="asterisk" class="asterisk-left"></i><em>Also, my name’s not Jack.</em><i data-lucide="asterisk" class="asterisk-right"></i></p>
      <p><i data-lucide="brain"></i> My brain wears Nikes, it's always running.</p>
      <p><i data-lucide="help-circle"></i> I'm comfortable wrestling two-truths at once, being uncomfortable is where we grow. I like to think I can simplify complexity, finding and understanding what matters amongst the noise.</p>
      <p><i data-lucide="zap"></i> I think deeply, explore broadly, and often ask too many questions. I'm a bit of an anarchist in all the right ways; (your grandmother loves me).</p>
      <p><i data-lucide="flame"></i> That being said, sometimes being a menace is a <em style="color:indianred">me</em> problem, but sometimes, it isn't always <em style="color:indianred">my</em> problem.</p>
      <p><i data-lucide="dna"></i> Somewhere along the way, I came to understand that I’m twice-exceptional (2e) — a term for those with both cognitive Giftedness and ADHD/ASD. For me it's Giftedness + ADHD. It falls under the neurodivergent umbrella.</p>
      <p><i data-lucide="layers"></i> Being 2e means I default to thinking outside the box, I'm always looking in, trying to understand:</p>
      <blockquote>
        How did the box earn its place on the shelf?<br>
        What is holding the box together?<br>
        Where did the box even come from?<br>
        Is it even the right box?<br>
      </blockquote>
      <p><i data-lucide="circuit-board"></i> It’s part of my wiring, understanding the box's purpose before even using it. Now I hear you ask <em>"What does <strong>that</strong> even mean?"</em> Put simply — I see and interact with the world differently.</p>
      <p class="identity-callout">
        <span style="color: #5fae6e;">Wiring? Sure.</span> 
        <span style="color: #888;"> Identity? Nah.</span>
      </p>
      <p><i data-lucide="globe"></i> I built this website as a place to post my stories, perspectives, frameworks, ideas.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Sometimes they're written on a napkin.<br> Sometimes they're blueprints.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><i data-lucide="mail"></i> If what I write about clicks, stick around, have a read — I can be quite endearing at times — <a href="/contact">say g'Day</a> if you'd like. If not, no stress — there’s an <i data-lucide="x" style="color:red"></i> right up there in the corner of your browser — feel free to use it.</p>
