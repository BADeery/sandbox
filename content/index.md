    <p><i data-lucide="brain"></i> I’m an everything-thinker who finds peace amongst the chaos.</p>
    <p><i data-lucide="wrench" class="icon-adjust"></i> I consider myself a Swiss Army Knife{% quip "I mean, my name isn't Jack anyway" %} — I'm great at a lot of things — but I know when to hand it off to an expert.</p>

    <p><i data-lucide="help-circle"></i> I'm comfortable wrestling two-truths at once. Discomfort is where we grow. I like to think I can simplify complexity — cutting through the noise to find what actually matters.</p>
    <p><i data-lucide="zap"></i> I think deeply, explore broadly, and often ask too many questions. I'm a bit of an anarchist in all the right ways (your grandmother loves me).</p>
    <p><i data-lucide="flame"></i> That being said, sometimes being a menace is a <em style="color:indianred">me</em> problem — but sometimes, it isn’t always <em style="color:indianred">my</em> problem.</p>

    <h2><i data-lucide="circuit-board"></i> Wired Differently</h2>
    <p>Somewhere along the way, I came to understand that I’m twice-exceptional (2e) — a term used for those who are both Gifted and have another neurodivergent trait. For me, it's Giftedness + ADHD.</p>
    <p>I was diagnosed with ADHD at five — but it wasn’t until recently I realised Giftedness is medically codified, not just a word for being good at stuff.</p>
    <p>Being 2e means I default to thinking and operating outside the box. Always looking in and trying to understand:</p>
      <blockquote>
        How did the box earn its place on the shelf?<br>
        What is holding the box together?<br>
        Where did the box even come from?<br>
        Is it even the right box?<br>
      </blockquote>
    <p>I don’t always slot neatly into systems — I need to understand them, test them, sometimes reassemble them — guided by curiosity and instinct. Put simply, I just see and interact with the world differently.</p>

    <p><i data-lucide="globe"></i> This site is a sandbox. A place to post ideas, reflections, stories, and frameworks — from the messy ones to the methodical ones.</p>

    <p><i data-lucide="mail"></i> If something I write clicks, stick around — I can be quite endearing when I’m not being difficult. <a href="/contact">Say g'day</a> if you feel like it.
